I accidentally stumbed on this logbook. It belonged to a pirate, so maybe there
could be a hint about a treasure hidden in there.

Instructions: read Git log in order to get hints. No other Git commands are
allowed, but using git log parameters is even recommended. If you want to read
the story in right order, use --reverse.

Hint: treasure is a file (no, not this readme)
